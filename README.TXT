ShopEazy is a JAVA-based simple program designed to emulate an online
storefront.

To run the program, go to the folder labeled "dist" and execute "ShopEazy.jar" through 
the OpenJDK Platform binary.

DESCRIPTION
==========

Currently, there are ten items that can be viewed in the item menu section of 
the program. Each of the items has a subsequent item name, price, and product 
description along with an item image. 

The next tab, the shopping cart allows the user to create their own invoice, 
by writing the name of the item, the quantity, and the price of the item. The 
program will return the subtotal, then return the final cost including taxes (6.25%
according to Texas Goods and Services Tax). You can then input the amount of cash
given and it will return the balance, and if the cash is short, return the amount required
if need be.

The last panel is the Employee Login panel which currently shows a dialog box when
clicked on. It can later on be implemented with more features in future versions.
